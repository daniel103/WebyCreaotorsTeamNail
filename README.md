# Anastasiya Ganeeva 

We made a website for Anastasiya Ganeeva nail salon.
Which is used to help her costumer and new costumer to find out about her service.

This is a concluding project for our Weby Creator Team portfolio. We used HTML, SCSS, TypeScript.

## Challenges

Some of the challenges we were trying to work to implement a google translator to translate the page from Russian to get to wider costumer. Which didnâ€™t work because we after to refreshment or opening a new page it disappeared. We tried to look for a a solution and looked for answers from the internet, but nothing explained how to fix it. We tried changing the the function and to implement the script in different places . We will try to find a new solution for it in the near futures.
